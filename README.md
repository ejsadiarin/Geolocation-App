# GEOLOCATION APP 
- A tracking app made with Google Maps API, Geocoding API, Elevation API, and more. Made with React
- uses Google Maps API, Geocoding API, Elevation API, etc (protected in a .env file).

## Reasons for doing
- master DATA FETCHING, most common yet in my opinion, the most important skill in development:
  - storing information/data
  - retrieving information/data
  - displaying information/data

## Learnings
- tested A LOT of APIs for this one, since can't figure out how to settle billing for Google Cloud until I did
- APIs tested (for own reference):
  - Mapbox (Most reliable alternative)
  - OpenTopoData (open source, can be self-hosted) - has professional datasets for elevation and topography (ASTER, ETOPO1, Mapzen, NZ DEM, NED, SRTM. GEBCO bathmetry, EMOD bathmetry, etc.)
  - Open Weather Map
  - IP stack
  - Apify
  - Open-elevation
  - ElevationAPI
  - Open-meteo
  - Geocode xyz
